|    Output to Console		|
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To output anything to the console do the following:
Call the script scr_Console_Log_Write from anywhere and pass up to two parameters. The first is the message you want to output, the second is the type of message (which dictates the colour the text is in). If no colour is passed, the default colour is used.

The output types are:
=================================
"reg"/"regular" 		| Basic regular output, grey colour
"command"			| Command output, pink colour
"error"				| Error log output, red colour
"ai"				| Ai/System output, blue colour
default (no type given)		| Default output, yellow colour
=================================

Example calls are:
=================================
scr_Console_Log_Write("Hello World", "ai"); //Outputs 'Hello World' in blue as it is type 'ai'
scr_Console_Log_Write("No object found with ID: " + str_obj_ID, "error"); //Outputs 'No object found with ID:######' in red as it is type 'error'
=================================
